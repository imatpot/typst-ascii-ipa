# Typst IPA

A direct port from [the Rust ipa-translate crate](https://github.com/tirimid/ipa-translate) by [tirimid](https://github.com/tirimid)'s conversion features into native [Typst](https://typst.app). Props to them for doing all the *actual* work!

This essentially allows you to enter linguistic notation, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the different brackets and braces that accompany it, using several ASCII-encoded substitutions.

## Usage

Check out the [`README.typ`](README.typ#L15) and its compilation [`README.pdf`](README.pdf) for all the details you need. Feel free to compile it and play around a little bit.
